# Modern-C

Welcome to the **Modern-C** repository! This collection showcases C programs that leverage features introduced in the latest C23 standard. These programs are designed to compile and run correctly using the C23 standard, but they may produce warnings or fail to compile with earlier C standards.

## Features

- **C23 Compliance**: All programs in this repository are written to comply with the C23 standard.
- **Modern Syntax and Features**: Explore the latest features of C, including enhanced type inference, new standard library functions, and improved syntax.
- **Warnings and Compatibility**: Programs may generate warnings or errors when compiled with C11 or C17 standards, illustrating the evolution of the C programming language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you will need:

- A C compiler that supports the C23 standard (e.g., GCC 13 or later, Clang 16 or later).
- A basic understanding of C programming.

### Installation
